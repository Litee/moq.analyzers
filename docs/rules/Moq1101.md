`.SetupGet()` and `.SetupSet()` are methods for mocking properties, not methods. Use `.Setup()` to mock methods instead.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
interface IMyInterface
{
    string Method();
}

var mock = new Mock<IMyInterface>().SetupGet(x => x.Method()); // Moq1101: SetupGet/SetupSet should be used for properties, not for methods
```

## Solution

```csharp
interface IMyInterface
{
    string Method();
}

var mock = new Mock<IMyInterface>().Setup(x => x.Method());
```
