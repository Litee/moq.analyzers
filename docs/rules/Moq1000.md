Mocking requires generating a subclass of the class to be mocked. Sealed classes cannot be subclassed. To fix:

- Introduce an interface and mock that instead
- Use the real class and not a mock
- Unseal the class

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

```csharp
sealed class MyClass { }

var mock = new Mock<MyClass>(); // Moq1000: Sealed classes cannot be mocked
```

## Solution

```csharp
class MyClass { }

var mock = new Mock<MyClass>();
```
