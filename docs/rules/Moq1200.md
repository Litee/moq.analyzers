# Moq1200: Setup should be used only for overridable members

Mocking requires generating a subclass of the class to be mocked. Methods not marked `virtual` cannot be overridden.
To fix:

- Mock an interface instead of a clas
- Make the method to be mocked `virtual`

```csharp
class SampleClass
{
    int Property { get; set; }
}

var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>()
    .Setup(x => x.Property); // Moq1200: Setup should be used only for overridable members
```

## Solution

```csharp
class SampleClass
{
    virtual int Property { get; set; }
}

var mock = new Mock<SampleClass>()
    .Setup(x => x.Property);
```
